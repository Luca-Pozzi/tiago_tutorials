# TIAGo Tutorials

This repo contains the code to run the [TIAGo tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TIAGo/Tutorials). If you are reading this README file, then you are in the `melodic-devel` branch (developed by Luca). To go back to the original branch (developed by PAL Robotics), run `git checkout kinetic-devel` from the `tiago_tutorials` root folder.
Below there is a list (manually updated) of the tutorials affected by changes:

- `pick_demo`

## TODO

- in `pick_demo`
  - [ ] fix the table dimension
  - [ ] get the objects dimension in input instead of having them hardcoded as params
